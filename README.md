# Custom Dice Project

This is a simple custom dice project, users can create and remove a limitless number of custom sides to the dice. When rolled the dice will output a random item from the list.

This dice may be useful to those wanting to optimise an unpredicatble reward structure, by inputing several rewards and rolling one of them at random as necessary.

 In order to better support this use case I will be updating this project with additional features such as programable weighted dice capability, restricted rolling and list saving.
